# Summary
As an IT recruiter with a passion for connecting top talent with exciting opportunities, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and recruitment skills to the table. I am adept at utilizing sourcing tools like LinkedIn Recruiter, GitHub, Stack Overflow, and so on to identify and engage with highly skilled professionals in various IT domains.

Having a little bit of coding experience in school/college years and a broad knowledge of IT, I possess an understanding of programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, C#, and SQL, as well as cloud technologies like AWS and DevOps practices.
